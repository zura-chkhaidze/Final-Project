                <img class="news-img" src="images/img1.jpg" alt="img">
                <p class="second-div-p">  In a tiny, lab-grown garden, the first seeds ever sown in lunar dirt
                     have sprouted. This small crop, planted in samples returned by Apollo
                     missions, offers hope that astronauts could someday grow their own food on the moon.
                     But plants potted in lunar dirt grew more slowly and were scrawnier than others grown 
                     in volcanic material from Earth, researchers report May 12 in Communications Biology.
                     That finding suggests that farming on the moon would take a lot more than a green thumb
                     “Ah! It’s so cool!” says University of Wisconsin–Madison astrobotanist Richard Barker of the experiment.
                     “Ever since these samples came back, there’s been botanists that wanted to know what would happen if you
                     grew plants in them,” says Barker, who wasn’t involved in the study. “But everyone knows those precious 
                     samples … are priceless, and so you can understand why [NASA was] reluctant to release them.”
                     Now, NASA’s upcoming plans to send astronauts back to the moon as part of its Artemis
                     program have offered a new incentive to examine that precious dirt and explore how 
                     lunar resources could support long-term missions.

                <p class="second-div-p">
                 A Venus flytrap’s short-term “memory” can last about 30 seconds. If an insect taps the plant’s sensitive hairs only once,
                 the trap remains still. But if the insect taps again within about half a minute, the carnivorous plant’s leaves snap
                 shut, ensnaring its prey.
                 How Venus flytraps (Dionaea muscipula) remember that initial touch has been a mystery. A new study reveals that 
                 the plants do so using calcium, researchers report online October 5 in Nature Plants.
                 Scientists know that some plants have a type of long-term memory, says study coauthor
                 Mitsuyasu Hasebe, a biologist at the National Institute for Basic Biology in Okazaki, Japan.
                 One example is vernalization, whereby plants remember long periods of winter cold as a signal to
                 flower in the spring. But short-term memory is more enigmatic, and “this is the first direct 
                 evidence of the involvement of calcium,” Hasebe says.
                 Even though the carnivorous plant, famous for its jawlike leaves, has no brain or nervous system,
                 it can apparently count to five and distinguish between live prey and things like rain, which could
                 inadvertently trigger its leaves to snap shut, wasting energy.

                     When you’re essentially a little ball of floof, flying is hard.
                     To ride the wind, dandelion seeds stir up a weird type of whirlpool in the air directly above them.
                     The newly discovered way of moving through the air, described October 17 in Nature, resolves a 
                     long-standing question about how the seeds stay aloft.
                     Dandelion seed flight is not unlike the flight of Mary Poppins: 
                     Utterly charming, yet inexplicable when it comes to physics — until now.
                     When a gust of wind plucks a seed from the plant’s fuzzy head, a fluffy 
                     structure called the pappus keeps the seed aloft before it ultimately falls to the ground. 
                     The structure, which extends from the seed, is made up of tiny hairlike filaments, 
                     making it mostly empty space.
                     “It’s a weird structure,” says coauthor Naomi Nakayama, a biophysicist at the University of Edinburgh.
                      “Nobody really knew how it could fly.”
                     So Nakayama and her colleagues dug into the weeds. High-speed video and mathematical simulations 
                     revealed that the pappus filaments act together like a uniform sheet or a parachute and create drag — a 
                     force that counters gravity.  Air also flows around the pappus and gets sucked into the area just above.
