                <img class="news-img" src="images/img1.jpg" alt="img" />
                <p class="second-div-p">
                    In a tiny, lab-grown garden, the first seeds ever sown in lunar dirt
                    have sprouted. This small crop, planted in samples returned by
                    Apollo missions, offers hope that astronauts could someday grow
                    their own food on the moon. But plants potted in lunar dirt grew
                    more slowly and were scrawnier than others grown in volcanic
                    material from Earth, researchers report May 12 in Communications
                    Biology. That finding suggests that farming on the moon would take a
                    lot more than a green thumb “Ah! It’s so cool!” says University of
                    Wisconsin–Madison astrobotanist Richard Barker of the experiment.
                    “Ever since these samples came back, there’s been botanists that
                    wanted to know what would happen if you grew plants in them,” says
                    Barker, who wasn’t involved in the study. “But everyone knows those
                    precious samples … are priceless, and so you can understand why
                    [NASA was] reluctant to release them.” Now, NASA’s upcoming plans to
                    send astronauts back to the moon as part of its Artemis program have
                    offered a new incentive to examine that precious dirt and explore
                    how lunar resources could support long-term missions.

                    How Venus flytraps store short-term ‘memories’ of prey
                </h4>
                <img class="news-img" src="images/img2.jpg" alt="img" />
                <p class="second-div-p">
                    A Venus flytrap’s short-term “memory” can last about 30 seconds. If
                    an insect taps the plant’s sensitive hairs only once, the trap
                    remains still. But if the insect taps again within about half a
                    minute, the carnivorous plant’s leaves snap shut, ensnaring its
                    prey. How Venus flytraps (Dionaea muscipula) remember that initial
                    touch has been a mystery. A new study reveals that the plants do so
                    using calcium, researchers report online October 5 in Nature Plants.
                    Scientists know that some plants have a type of long-term memory,
                    says study coauthor Mitsuyasu Hasebe, a biologist at the National
                    Institute for Basic Biology in Okazaki, Japan. One example is
                    vernalization, whereby plants remember long periods of winter cold
                    as a signal to flower in the spring. But short-term memory is more
                    enigmatic, and “this is the first direct evidence of the involvement
                    of calcium,” Hasebe says. Even though the carnivorous plant, famous
                    for its jawlike leaves, has no brain or nervous system, it can
                    apparently count to five and distinguish between live prey and
                    things like rain, which could inadvertently trigger its leaves to
                    snap shut, wasting energy.

                    Dandelion seeds create a bizarre whirlpool in the air
                </h4>
                <img class="news-img" src="images/img3.jpg" alt="img" />
                <p class="second-div-p">
                    When you’re essentially a little ball of floof, flying is hard. To
                    ride the wind, dandelion seeds stir up a weird type of whirlpool in
                    the air directly above them. The newly discovered way of moving
                    through the air, described October 17 in Nature, resolves a
                    long-standing question about how the seeds stay aloft. Dandelion
                    seed flight is not unlike the flight of Mary Poppins: Utterly
                    charming, yet inexplicable when it comes to physics — until now.
                    When a gust of wind plucks a seed from the plant’s fuzzy head, a
                    fluffy structure called the pappus keeps the seed aloft before it
                    ultimately falls to the ground. The structure, which extends from
                    the seed, is made up of tiny hairlike filaments, making it mostly
                    empty space. “It’s a weird structure,” says coauthor Naomi Nakayama,
                    a biophysicist at the University of Edinburgh. “Nobody really knew
                    how it could fly.” So Nakayama and her colleagues dug into the
                    weeds. High-speed video and mathematical simulations revealed that
                    the pappus filaments act together like a uniform sheet or a
                    parachute and create drag — a force that counters gravity. Air also
                    flows around the pappus and gets sucked into the area just above.
